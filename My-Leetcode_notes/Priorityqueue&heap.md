**What is Priority Queue**
* It's a data structure that allows you to get the maximum number from a tree using o(1) time
and pop the maximum number or insert any value into the tree using o(logn) time meanwhile
keeping the structures of the tree.

* -----------------**Priority queue properties**-------------------------

* Every item has a priority associated with it
* The first item removed from a queue has the highest priority 
* The queue is either sorted in ascending order or in descending order;
If sorted in acending order, then the smallest number is on the top of the tree;
*On the other hand, the element with the maximum value in the heap will be removed first
in a priority queue with descending order.
