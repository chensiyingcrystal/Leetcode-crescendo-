# Tree Week Review
**Questions review**

* Tree's Depthï¼š
   * 1. Maximum depth of binary tree
   * [104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
   * Keypoints: 
        * dfs: basic recursion
        * bfs: level traversing(convert this problem to counting levels of binary tree)

   * 2. Minimum depth of binary tree
   * [111](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
   * Keypoints: 
        * dfs: basic recursion with several base cases!!
        * bfs: level traversing(early return during level traversing)
    
   * 3. Muted problem: 559
   * [559]

* Tree's properties
   * 1. Balanced tree
   * [110](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)
   * Keypoints: 
        * understanding what is a balanced tree
        * need to update two messages during one time dfs traversing
        * trick: can use pair but is better to use one variable to represent two messages!


   * 2. Minimum depth of binary tree
